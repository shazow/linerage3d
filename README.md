# LineRage 3D

Vague attempt at a 3D remake of my older game, [LineRage](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linerage/oplmlhhgdcliikihbehklkagmeophnlh?hl=en-US).

Status: Spinny line. No gameplay, just messing around with 3D stuff.

There's a bunch of junk all over the place, eventually I'd like to clean this up
into a coherent library and game code.
